# Svelte Mood Tracker

Svelte Mood Tracker is a web application that allows the user to track their activities, feelings and overall mood.

This is a project for the course Web Application Development(Sviluppo di Applicazioni Web) at the University of Pisa.

This application is written using Svelte and hosted in cloudflare pages.

## Specifications

This application will:

- Allow the user to record data on their mood
- Show diagrams showing overview and correlations.
- Use end-to-end encryption to ensure complete privacy
- Send notifications to remind the user to insert data and view weekly/monthly reports.
- Work offline and syncronize when it's back online.

## Next

To do:

- Put "diary", "new entry" and "activities" in different pages.
	- "Diary" will have the list of previous entries.
	- "New entry" will allow the user to input a new entry.
	- "Activities" will allow the user to add new activities, change their names, and hide them.
- Make a store for diary entries
- Implement server syncronisation.

I'm not making the CSS better for a while.
